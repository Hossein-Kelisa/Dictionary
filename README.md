# Dictionary App

## Description

This is my first individual project using APIs. A simple English-to-English dictionary app that allows users to search for word meanings and synonyms using an API. The app provides a responsive UI with dynamic updates.

## Features

- Search for word meanings and synonyms
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- API fetching with `fetch()`
- Dynamic UI updates
- Loading and error handling
- Dark mode

## Additional Notes

- A `setTimeout` is used to show the loading icon for an additional 500ms during searches.
- Click [here](<https://Hossein-kelisa.github.io/Dictionary>) to use the app online.
- If the API cannot find a word, it displays a **First Error** message.
- If the API finds the word but lacks a meaning or synonym, it displays a **Second Error** message.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
- DOM Manipulation
